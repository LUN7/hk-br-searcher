# Study the problem

1. To me the problem in Exercise is quite straight forward
2. First I would write some unit tests to describe the requirement
3. Secondly I would write a script with puppeteer to fetch the data
4. Make sure all tests are pass
5. If time available I would add some more feature for fun

# Writing unit test

# Setting up the env

1. puppeteer
2. jest (for testing)
3. Dockerfile and Compose to contain everything
